<h1 align="center"> Visual AI </h1>
<br>
<p align="center">Visual is a AI that uses machine learning to understand the interest of a user with data that is obtained, to in turn generate topics the user probally likes.</p>

<h2> Usage</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/ondcObRzXHxIANFAJ0/giphy.gif" width="480" height="234"> </p>
<p>To use Visual you need to follow the steps of installation. Visual is intended to collect data so the service provider can create reliable suggestions. We advise that Visual is used for only applications and or websites. To get it running you need to link a source of information to the WordKeeper.py script. When you have it linked to a source and it is storing data for you in the JSON file, you can start the Visual.py script. You need to keep the window open so the AI can do its work.</p>

<p> Disclaimer: Visual is still work in progress. We do not support any misuse of Visual.</p>

<h2> Storyboard</h2>
  <pre>
  - Create projecct (✔)
  - Make a python script that can be accessed to add data to some kind of storage (✔)
  - Make a script that generates a list of intrest based on the most used words/terms. (✔)
  - Create a AI/Program to generate the most accurate intrest list all the time (✔)
  - Introduce machine learning for a better process (✔)
  - Develop more in machine learning for better quality
  - Create more storyboard points</pre>
  
## Building
To build Visual you need:
- A clone/release of Bamboo
- A clone/release of Visual

<h2> Installation</h2>
  <h3> Visual</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Link the WordKeeper.py script to a source that can enter data for it</li>
    <li>Run the Visual.py script</li>
    <li>Let it keep running</li>
  </ul>
  <p> If Visual.py script says "List Of Topics Has Been Adjusted", it means that the AI is running.</p>
  
 <h3> Bamboo</h3>
 
 <pre>
   cd\
   cd [Path_To_Bamboo.sh]
   sh Bamboo.sh</pre>
