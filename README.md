<h1 align="center"> Visual AI </h1>
<br>
<p align="center">Visual is a AI that uses machine learning to understand the interest of a user with data that is obtained, to in turn generate topics the user probally likes.</p>

## Building
To build Visual you need:
- A clone/release of Bamboo
- A clone/release of Visual

<h2> Installation</h2>
 <h3> Bamboo</h3>
 <pre>
   cd\
   cd [Path_To_Bamboo.sh]
   sh Bamboo.sh</pre>

   You can find more detail on my other repo:

  <h3> Visual</h3>
  <code>
   More details will be comming</code>
<h2> Usage</h2>

<p>Visual is still in the making so this part will be updated/changed. To use visual you need to access the wordkeeper.py script. With this you can add data to the JSON storage. After this you can use the filter.py script to generate a small list of intrest the user probally has. The recommendation of using Visual is for website that uses search bars.</p>
<h2> Storyboard</h2>
  <pre>
  - Create projecct (✔)
  - Make a python that can be accessed to add data to some kind of storage (✔)
  - Make a script that generates a list of intrest based on the most used words/terms. (✔)
  - Create a AI/Program that uses these scripts to activly to generate the most accurate intrest list all the time
  - Introduce machine learning for a better process
  - Create more storyboard points</pre>
